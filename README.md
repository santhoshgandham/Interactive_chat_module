This project is a simple interactive chat module between two ESP32 devices over Wi-Fi, where one acts as a TCP server and the other connects as a client. Data typed into the Serial Monitor on either side is sent over a socket and mirrored back, essentially creating a small Serial-to-Wi-Fi bridge without MQTT or external services. It was built mostly for debugging and experimenting with raw TCP communication between microcontrollers. The code is minimal: the server sets up an AP and listens on port 80, while the client maintains a connection and forwards bytes in both directions. It’s not a chat application in the usual sense—more of a lightweight testbed for low-latency bidirectional communication between ESP boards.
